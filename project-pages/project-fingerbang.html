I had thought up the original concept some time earlier, and suggested it as a basis for further refinement for my partner-in-crime Aleksi Pellinen. After additional ideation and a quick two-week gameplay prototype later, we ended up among the few concepts selected for further production.</div>

              <div class="body-text">This very early prototype was created in two weeks by me, using a mix of proprietary graphical assets made by Aleksi and premade textures. Due to time constraints the prototype level was put together using Unity's default cubes. The entire prototype consists of only 12 simple scripts, mostly allowing for basic interactions between the player and enemies. This would however end up serving as the basis upon which the eventual project would be built.</div>

              <div class="body-text">At the beginning of pre-production, we as a team made some clear guidelines for ourselves going forward, such as setting in stone the scale for objects in the project (1 unit in Unity would roughly correspond to one meter, and every "tile" would be 4x4 units in size for example). Almost immediately afterwards I began working on our first level, the initial plan for which was to only cover the basic mechanics of the game and immediately lead into the main level planned for the game.</div>
